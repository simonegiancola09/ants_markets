    Load ants' events data 3 DataFrames: 

    1)  events_collectivity dataset. 
        For each event in the dataset, the following fields are provided:
        * colony - colony identifier
        * N - number of ants in colony
        * S - the set temperature of the perturbation
        * thermistor - the time course of the thermistor measurements (spatially averaged)
        * thcam - the time course of the thermal camera measurements (spatially averaged)
        * ant_binary - a vector of the binary response of each ant
        * ant_latency - a vector of response latency for each ant
        * ant_direction - a vecor of response direction as defined in the paper

    2)  events_threshold_tagged.
        For each event in the dataset, the following fields are provided:
        * colony - colony identifier
        * N - number of ants in colony
        * S - the set temperature of the perturbation
        * thermistor - the time course of the thermistor measurements (spatially averaged)
        * thcam - the time course of the thermal camera measurements (spatially averaged)
        * Np - approximate number of ants outside the nest for each time period
        * collective_binary - 1 if > 90% of the ants evacuated the nest, 0 otherwise

    3)  events_groupsize_untagged.
        For each event in the dataset, the following fields are provided:
        * colony - colony identifier
        * N - number of ants in colony
        * S - the set temperature of the perturbation
        * thermistor - the time course of the thermistor measurements (spatially averaged)
        * thcam - the time course of the thermal camera measurements (spatially averaged)
        * Np - approximate number of ants outside the nest for each time period
        * collective_binary - 1 if > 90% of the ants evacuated the nest, 0 otherwise
