'''
This code creates an instance of the InvestorModel class with 50 investors, a maximum trade size of 10, an external variable of 0.1, and an initial stock price of 100.
 It also creates a chart to visualize the stock price over time and a network visualization of 
 the investor network. Finally, it creates a server to run the simulation and starts the server 
 on a chosen port.

You can access the visualization by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:8521/. 
You should see a network visualization of the investor network and a chart of the stock 
price over time. You can then click the "Run" button to start the simulation and watch it 
evolve over time.
