Simulation and Modeling exam Project
Git commands to work on it
------------
We take the simplest possible structure for now, and see how it goes. 
There will be one remote branch (i.e. `main`) and one local branch on our 
computer (i.e. `main` as well). 

To start we go to a folder we want to work on and call on the terminal 
`git clone (link to clone repository)`. This will copy over the project in 
our local pc. 

Then suppose we make some changes on the code, and save them, we would 
like to apply those changes, to do so we call on the terminal
`git add .` (the dot means everything)
`git commit -m "message to explain what has been done"`
`git push origin main` (to apply the changes)

Say some days pass by and our local project is not yet updated, to recover 
the remote changes it should be sufficient to call on the terminal the 
command 
`git pull origin main`
